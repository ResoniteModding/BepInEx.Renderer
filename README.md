# BepInEx.Renderer

A specialized BepInEx build for modding the Resonite Unity renderer process.

This package provides the core BepInEx framework configured specifically for Resonite's renderer. It serves as a dependency for [RenderiteHook](https://github.com/ResoniteModding/RenderiteHook) and other renderer-side modifications.
